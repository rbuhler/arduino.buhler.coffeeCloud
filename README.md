## From Cofee to Cloud 
 <div style="text-align: justify;">

The project _From Cofee to Cloud_ aims at presenting an example of implementing Internet of Things (IoT) in a quick and easy way. 

### Use Case
The use case is the monitoring of a cofee machine where a luminosity sensor keeps reading the **ready light** until it gets on, meaning cofee ready to be served. This way its status can be monitored remotelly by the interested users (cofee addicteds).

For such an application it makes necessary the join of frontend and backend software development toghether with an integration with hardware for collecting data from the _external world_. In a try to bring to this example more simplicity it was choosen the support of SAP cloud environment, the programming language Python and Arduino hardware compatible.

### Hana Cloud Platform
Making use of the Hana Cloud infrastructure, more preciselly the Internet of Things (IoT) Service, it will be prepared an environment to receive and share data collected from a device.

### Arduino and Python
For the task of colleting data it will be used an Arduino board connected to a luminosity sensor. The reading is sent via serial port to a auxiliar device that's listening such port. The data is packed and sent to the cloud infrastructure.

### User Interface in HTML5 - UI5
In the other side it makes necessary to provide a interface the final user may have access with the data collected and interact with. The choosen technology for that is HTML5 with the use of Open UI5 library for better results.

## Hands On
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
In order to handle the data collected by the hardware an infrastructure shall be prepared. For such job Hana CLoud Platforma provides the Internet of Things Service that makes the service way easer.

The support proposed implementation follows what is described next:

### Internet of Things Services
Atrribute        | Value
-----------------|---------------------
Message Type     | _luminositySensor_ 
Device Type      | _arduino_
Device           | _uno_ 

### Mesasage Fields
Name | Type | Optional Settings
-----| -----| -----------------
sensor    | string  | Max. Length 255
timestamp | date    | 
value     | integer
